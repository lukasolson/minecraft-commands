# Minecraft Commands

This is just a little website to make it easier for my 5-year-old son to copy common commands in Minecraft.

What 5-year-old wants to sit and type `summon Skeleton ~ ~ ~ {Equipment:[{id:bow}],Riding:{id:Spider}}`? NONE. That's the answer. Yet every 5-year-old who plays Minecraft wants to summon a spider jockey. Fact.

How does it work? Each picture corresponds to a desirable command in Minecraft. Clicking on the picture copies the corresponding command to the clipboard.

Currently, the following commands are available:

* Change game mode to survival/creative
* Summon an ender crystal/giant zombie/ender dragon/wither/lightning bolt/snow golem/iron golem/charged creeper/chicken jockey/spider jockey
* Set the time to day/night
* Teleport all entities to player
* Set weather to clear/rain/thunder

Think another command would be useful? Create an issue for it.
